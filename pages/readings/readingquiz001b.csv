Ch1,2,"___ is concerned with describing speech. There are many different rea- sons for wanting to do this, which means that there are many kinds of phoneti- cians. Some are interested in the different sounds that occur in languages. Some study the cognitive processes involved in speaking and listening. Some are more concerned with pathological speech. Others are trying to help people speak a particular form of English. Still others are looking for ways to make computers talk more ___ or to get computers to recognize speech. For all these pur- poses, phoneticians need to find out what people are doing when they are talking and how the sounds of speech can be ___.","Phonetics, intelligibly, described"
Ch1,2,"We will begin by describing how speech sounds are made. Most sounds are the result of ___ of the tongue and the lips. We can think of these move- ments as gestures forming particular sounds. We can convey information by ges- tures of our hands that people can see, but in making speech that people can hear, humans have found a marvelously efficient way to impart information. The ___ of the tongue and lips are made ___ so that they can be heard and recognized.","movements, gestures, audible"
Ch1,2,"Making speech gestures audible involves pushing air out of the ___ while producing a noise in the throat or mouth. These basic ___ are changed by the actions of the tongue and lips. Later, we will study how the tongue and lips make about twenty-five different gestures to form the sounds of English. We can see some of these gestures by looking at an x-ray movie. Figure 1.1 shows a series of frames from an x-ray movie of the phrase ""on top of his deck"". In this sequence of twelve frames (one in every four frames of the movie), the tongue has been outlined to make it clearer. The lettering to the right of the frames shows, very roughly, the sounds being produced. The individual frames in the figure show that the tongue and lips move rapidly from one position to another. To appreciate how rapidly the ___ are being made, however, you should watch the movie.","lungs,noises, gestures"
Ch1,4,"Producing any sound requires ___ . In nearly all speech sounds, the basic source of power is the ___ system pushing air out of the lungs. Try to talk while breathing in instead of out. You will find that you can do it, but it is much harder than talking when breathing out. When you talk, air from the lungs goes up the windpipe (the ___ , to use the more technical term) and into the ___ , at which point it must pass between two small muscular folds called the vocal ___ . If they are apart (as yours probably are right now while you are breathing in and out), the air from the lungs will have a relatively ___ passage into the ___ and the mouth. But if the vocal folds are adjusted so that there is only a narrow passage between them, the airstream from the lungs will set them ___ . Sounds produced when the vocal folds are vibrating are said to be ___ , as opposed to those in which the vocal folds are ___ , which are said to be voiceless.","energy, respiratory, trachea, larynx, folds, free, pharynx, vibrating, voiced, apart"
Ch1,4,"In order to hear the difference between a voiced and a voiceless sound, try saying a long ‘v’ sound, which we will symbolize as [ vvvvv ]. Now compare this with a long ‘f’ sound [ fffff ], saying each of them ___—[ fffffvvvvvfffffvvvvv ]. (As indicated by the icon in the margin, an audio file illustrating this sequence is on the website.) Both of these sounds are formed in the same way in the mouth. The difference between them is that [ v ] is voiced and [ f ] is voiceless. You can feel the vocal fold ___ in [ v ] if you put your fingertips against your ___. You can also hear the buzzing of the vibrations in [ v ] more easily if you stop up your ears while contrasting [ fffffvvvvv ].","alternately, vibrations, larynx"
Ch1,4,"The air passages above the larynx are known as the ___ tract . Figure 1.2 shows their location within the head (actually, within Peter Ladefoged’s head, in a photograph taken many years ago). The ___ of the vocal tract is a very important factor in the production of speech, and we will often refer to a diagram of the kind that has been ___ on the photograph in Figure 1.2. Learn to draw the vocal tract by tracing the diagram in this figure. Note that the air passages that make up the vocal tract may be divided into the ___ tract, within the mouth and pharynx, and the ___ tract, within the nose. When the flap at the back of the mouth is lowered (as it probably is for you now, if you are breathing with your mouth shut), air goes in and out through the nose. Speech sounds such as [m] and [n] are produced with the vocal folds ___ and air going out through the ___. The upper limit of the nasal tract has been marked with a dotted line since the exact boundaries of the air passages within the nose depend on soft tissues of variable size.","tract, shape, superimposed, oral, nasal, vibrating, nose"
Ch1,5,"The parts of the vocal tract that can be used to form sounds, such as the tongue and the lips, are called ___. Before we discuss them, let’s summarize the speech production mechanism as a whole. Figure 1.3 (on page 6) shows the four main components—the ___ process, the ___ process, the ___ process, and the ___ process. The ___ process includes all the ways of pushing air out (and, as we will see later, of sucking it in) that provide the power for speech. For the moment, we have considered just the respiratory system, the lungs pushing out air, as the prime mover in this process. The ___ process is the name given to the actions of the vocal folds. Only two possibilities have been mentioned: ___ sounds in which the vocal folds are vibrating and ___ sounds in which they are apart. The possibility of the airstream going out through the mouth, as in [ v ] or [ z ], or the nose, as in [ m ] and [ n ], is determined by the oro-nasal. The movements of the tongue and lips interacting with the roof of the mouth and the pharynx are part of the articulatory process.","articulators, airstream, phonation, oro-nasal, articulatory, airstream, phonation, voiced, voiceless"
Ch1,10,"The parts of the vocal tract that can be used to form sounds are called ___. The articulators that form the lower surface of the vocal tract are highly ___. They make the gestures required for speech by moving toward the articulators that form the upper surface. Try saying the word capital and note the major movements of your tongue and lips. You will find that the ___ of the tongue moves up to make contact with the roof of the mouth for the first sound and then, comes down for the following vowel. The lips come together in the formation of p and then, come apart again in the vowel. The tongue ___ comes up for the t and again, for most people, for the final l.","articulators, mobile, back, tip"
Ch1,11,"The names of the principal parts of the upper surface of the vocal tract are given in Figure 1.6. The upper lip and the upper teeth (notably the frontal incisors) are familiar enough structures. Just behind the upper teeth is a small protuberance that you can feel with the tip of the tongue. This is called the alveolar ___. You can also feel that the front part of the roof of the mouth is formed by a bony structure. This is the hard ___. You will probably have to use a fingertip to feel farther back. Most people cannot curl the tongue up far enough to touch the ___, or ___ palate, at the back of the mouth. The ___ is a ___ ___ that can be raised to press against the back wall of the ___ and shut off the nasal tract, preventing air from going out through the nose. In this case, there is said to be a ___ closure. This action separates the nasal tract from the oral tract so that the air can go out only through the mouth. At the lower end of the soft palate is a small ___ hanging down that is known as the ___. The part of the vocal tract between the uvula and the larynx is the ___. The back wall of the pharynx may be considered one of the articulators on the ___ surface of the vocal tract.","ridge, palate, soft palate, velum, soft, muscular, flap, pharynx, velic, appendage, uvula, pharynx, upper"
Ch1,11,"Figure 1.7 shows the lower lip and the specific names for the parts of the tongue that form the ___ surface of the vocal tract. The ___ and ___ of the tongue are the most mobile parts. Behind the blade is what is technically called the ___ of the tongue; it is actually the forward part of the body of the tongue and lies underneath the hard palate when the tongue is at rest. The remainder of the body of the tongue may be divided into the ___, which is partly beneath the hard palate and partly beneath the soft palate; the ___, which is beneath the soft palate; and the ___, which is opposite the back wall of the pharynx. The ___ is attached to the lower part of the root of the tongue. You may find it helpful to review the names of the articulators using the web version of Homework Exercise A for Chapter 1. It is a fun interactive way to study this information.","lower, tip, blade, front, center, back, root, epiglottis"
Ch1,11,"Bearing all these terms in mind, say the word peculiar and try to give a rough description of the gestures made by the ___ organs during the consonant sounds. You should find that the ___ come together for the first sound. Then the back and center of the tongue are ___. But is the contact on the hard palate or on the velum? (For most people, it is centered between the two.) Then note the position in the formation of the l. Most people make this sound with the ___ of the tongue on the ___ ridge.","vocal, lips, raised, tip, alveolar"
Ch1,12,"When considering diagrams such as those we have been discussing, it is important to remember that they show only two dimensions. The vocal tract is a tube, and the positions of the sides of the tongue may be very different from the position of the center. In saying sigh, for example, there is a deep ___ in the center of the tongue that is not present when saying shy. We cannot represent this difference in a two-dimensional diagram that shows just the midline of the tongue—a so-called mid-sagittal view. We will be relying on mid-sagittal dia- grams of the vocal organs to a considerable extent in this book. But we should never let this ___ view become the sole basis for our conceptualization of speech sounds.","hollow, simplified"
Ch1,12,"In order to form consonants, the airstream through the vocal tract must be ___ in some way. Consonants can be classified according to the place and manner of this obstruction. The primary articulators that can cause an obstruction in most languages are the lips, the tongue tip and blade, and the back of the tongue. Speech gestures using the lips are called ___ articula- tions; those using the tip or blade of the tongue are called ___ articulations; and those using the back of the tongue are called ___ articulations.","obstructed, labial, coronal, dorsal"
Ch1,,"If we do not need to specify the ___ of articulation in great detail, then the articulators for the consonants of English (and of many other languages) can be described using these terms. The word topic, for example, begins with a ___ consonant; in the middle is a labial consonant; and at the end is a ___ conso- nant. Check this by feeling that the tip or blade of your tongue is raised for the first (coronal) consonant, your lips close for the second (labial) consonant, and the back of your tongue is raised for the final (dorsal) consonant.","place, coronal, dorsal"
Ch1,12,"These terms, however, do not ___ articulatory gestures in sufficient detail for many phonetic purposes. We need to know more than which articulator is mak- ing the gesture, which is what the terms labial, coronal, and dorsal tell us. We also need to know what part of the ___ vocal tract is involved. More specific places of articulation are indicated by the arrows going from one of the lower articulators to one of the upper articulators in Figure 1.8. Because there are so many possi- bilities in the coronal region, this area is shown in more detail at the right of the figure. The principal terms for the particular types of ___ required in the description of English are as follows.","specify, upper, obstruction"
Ch1,13,"Say the words thigh and thy. Some people (most speakers of American English as spoken in the Mid- west and on the West Coast) have the tip of the tongue protruding between the upper and lower front teeth; others (most speakers of British English) have it close behind the ___ front teeth. Both sounds are normal in English, and both may be called ___. If a distinction is needed, sounds in which the tongue protrudes between the teeth may be called ___.","upper, dental, interdental"
Ch1,13,"Again there are two pos- sibilities in English, and you should find out which you use. You may pronounce words such as tie, die, nigh, sigh, zeal, lie using the ___ of the tongue or the blade of the tongue. You may use the tip of the tongue for some of these words and the ___ for others. For example, some people pronounce [ s ] with the tongue tip tucked behind the lower teeth, producing the ___ at the alveolar ridge with the blade of the tongue; others have the tongue tip up for [ s ]. Feel how you normally make the alveolar consonants in each of these words, and then try to make them in the other way. A good way to ___ the difference between dental and alveolar sounds is to say ten and tenth (or n and nth). Which n is farther back? (Most people make the one in ten on the alveolar ___ and the one in tenth as a ___ sound with the tongue touching the upper front teeth.)","tip, blade, constriction, appreciate, ridge, dental"
Ch1,14,"Many speakers of English do not use ___ sounds at all. But some speakers begin words such as""rye, row, ray"" with ___ sounds. Note the position of the tip of your tongue in these words. Speakers who pronounce r at the ends of words may also have retroflex sounds with the tip of the tongue raised in words such as ""ire, hour,"" and ""air"".","retroflex, retroflex"
Ch1,14,"Say words such as shy, she, and show. During the consonants, the tip of your tongue may be down behind the lower front teeth or up near the alveolar ridge, but the ___ of the tongue is always close to the back part of the alveolar ridge. Because these sounds are made at the ___ between the alveo- lar ridge and the hard palate, they can also be called ___. It is possible to pronounce them with either the tip or blade of the tongue. Try saying shipshape with your tongue tip up on one occasion and down on another. Note that the blade of the tongue will always be raised. You may be able to feel the place of articulation more distinctly if you hold the position while taking in a breath through the mouth. The incoming air cools the region where there is greatest narrowing, the blade of the tongue and the back part of the alveolar ridge.","blade, boundary, palato-alveolar"
Ch1,14,"Say the word ""you"" very slowly so that you can isolate the consonant at the beginning. If you say this consonant by itself, you should be able to feel that it begins with the front of the tongue raised toward the ___ ___. Try to hold the beginning consonant position and breathe in through the mouth. You will probably be able to feel the rush of cold air between the front of the tongue and the hard palate. ","hard, palate"
Ch1,14,"The consonants that have the place of articulation farthest back in English are those that occur at the ___ of words such as hack, hag, and hang. In all these sounds, the ___ of the tongue is raised so that it touches the ___.","end, back, velum"
Ch1,14,"As you can tell from the descriptions of these articulatory gestures, the first two, ___ and ___, can be classified as ___, involving at least the ___ lip; the next four—dental, alveolar, retroflex, and palato-alveolar (post-alveolar)—are ___ articulations, with the ___ or ___ of the tongue raised; and the last, ___, is a ___ articulation, using the ___ of the tongue. ___ sounds are sometimes classified as ___ articulations and sometimes as ___ articulations, a point to which we shall return.","bilabial, labiodental, labial, lower, coronal, tip, blade, velar, dorsal, back, Palatal, coronal, dorsal"
Ch1,14,"To get the feeling of different places of articulation, consider the consonant at the beginning of each of the following words: fee, theme, see, she. Say these consonants by themselves. Are they voiced or voiceless? Now note that the place of articulation moves back in the mouth in making this series of ___ consonants, going from labiodental, through dental and alveolar, to ___-alveolar.","voiceless, palato"
Ch1,15,"Consider the consonants at the ends of rang, ran, and ram. When you say these consonants by themselves, note that the air is coming out through the ___. In the formation of these sounds in sequence, the point of articulatory ___ moves forward, from velar in rang, through alveolar in ran, to bilabial in ram. In each case, the air is ___ from going out through the ___ but is able to go out through the nose because the soft palate, or ___, is ___.","nose, closure, prevented, mouth, velum, lowered"
Ch1,15,"In most speech, the soft palate is raised so that there is a ___ closure. When it is lowered and there is an ___ in the mouth, we say that there is a nasal consonant. Raising or lowering the ___ controls the oro-nasal process, the distinguishing factor between ___ and nasal sounds.","velic, obstruction, velum, oral"
Ch1,15,"At most places of articulation, there are several basic ways in which articulatory gestures can be accomplished. The articulators may close off the oral tract for an instant or a relatively long period; they may ___ the space considerably; or they may simply ___ the shape of the tract by approaching each other.","narrow, modify"
Ch1,15,"If, in addition to the articulatory closure in the mouth, the soft palate is raised so that the nasal tract is blocked off, then the airstream will be completely obstructed. ___ in the mouth will build up and an ___ stop will be formed. When the articulators come apart, the airstream will be released in a small ___ of sound. This kind of sound occurs in the consonants in the words ""pie, buy (bilabial closure)"", ""tie, dye (alveolar closure)"", and ""kye, guy (velar closure)"". Figure 1.9 shows the positions of the vocal organs in the bilabial stop in ""buy"". These sounds are called ___ in the International Phonetic Association’s (IPA’s) alphabet (see inside the front cover of this book). ","Pressure, oral, burst, plosives"
Ch1,15,"If the air is stopped in the oral cavity but the soft palate is down so that air can go out through the nose, the sound produced is a ___ stop. Sounds of this kind occur at the beginning of the words my (bilabial closure) and nigh (alveolar closure), and at the end of the word sang (velar closure). Figure 1.10 (on page 16) shows the position of the vocal organs during the ___ nasal stop in my. Apart from the presence of a ___ opening, there is no difference between this stop and the one in buy shown in Figure 1.9 (on page 16). Although both the nasal sounds and the oral sounds can be classified as ___, the term stop by itself is almost always used by phoneticians to indicate an ___ stop, and the term ___ to indicate a nasal stop. Thus, the consonants at the beginnings of the words ""day"" and ""neigh"" would be called an alveolar stop and an alveolar ___, respectively. Although the term stop may be defined so that it applies only to the prevention of air escaping through the mouth, it is commonly used to imply a complete ___ of the airflow through both the nose and the mouth.","nasal, bilabial, velic, stops, oral, nasal, nasal, stoppage"
Ch1,17,"The mechanism involved in mak- ing these slightly ___ sounds may be likened to that involved when the wind whistles around a corner. The consonants in :fie, vie (labiodental), thigh, thy (dental), sigh, zoo (alveolar), and shy (palato-alveolar)"" are examples of ___ sounds. Figure 1.11 illustrates one pronunciation of the palato-alveolar fricative consonant in ""shy"". Note the narrowing of the vocal tract between the blade of the tongue and the back part of the alveolar ridge. The higher-pitched sounds with a more obvious hiss, such as those in ""sigh"" and ""shy"", are sometimes called ___.","hissing, fricative, sibilants"
Ch1,17,"In saying the first sound in ""yacht"", the front of the tongue is raised toward the ___ area of the roof of the mouth, but it does not come close enough for a fricative sound to be produced. The consonants in the word we (approximation between the lips and in the velar region) and, for some people, in the word ""raw (approximation in the alveolar region)"" are also examples of ___.","palatal, approximants"
Ch1,18,"Say the word ""lie"" and note how the tongue touches near the center of the alveolar ridge. Prolong the initial consonant and note how, despite the closure formed by the tongue, air flows out freely, over the side of the tongue. Because there is no stoppage of the air, and not even any fricative noises, these sounds are classified as ___. The consonants in words such as lie and laugh are alveolar lateral approximants, but they are usually called just alveolar ___, their approximant status being assumed. You may be able to find out which side of the tongue is not in contact with the roof of the mouth by holding the consonant position while you breathe inward. The tongue will feel colder on the ___ that is not in contact with the roof of the mouth.","approximants, laterals, side"
Ch1,18,"In this preliminary chapter, it is not necessary to discuss all of the manners of articulation used in the various languages of the world—nor, for that matter, in English. But it might be useful to know the terms ___ (sometimes called roll) and tap (sometimes called ___). Tongue-tip trills occur in some forms of Scottish English in words such as rye and raw, and as the “rolled r” in Spanish. ___, in which the tongue makes a single tap against the alveolar ridge, occur in the middle of a word such as pity in many forms of American English.","trill, flap, Taps"
Ch1,18,"The production of some sounds involves more than one of these manners of articulation. Say the word ""cheap"" and think about how you make the first sound. At the beginning, the tongue comes up to make ___ with the back part of the alveo- lar ridge to form a stop closure. This contact is then slackened so that there is a fricative at the same place of articulation. This kind of combination of a stop imme- diately followed by a fricative is called an affricate, in this case a palato-alveolar (or post-alveolar) ___. There is a voiceless affricate at the beginning and end of the word ""church"". The corresponding voiced affricate occurs at the beginning and end of ""judge"". In all these sounds the articulators (tongue tip or blade and alveolar ridge) come together for the stop and then, instead of coming fully apart, separate only slightly so that a fricative is made at approximately the same place of articulation. Try to feel these movements in your own pronunciation of these words.","contact, affricate"
Ch1,18,"Words in English that start with a vowel in the spelling (like ""eek, oak, ark,"" etc.) are pronounced with a ___ stop at the beginning of the vowel. This “glottal catch” sound isn’t written in these words and is easy to overlook; but in a sequence of two words in which the first word ends with a vowel and the sec- ond starts with a vowel, the glottal stop is sometimes obvious. For example, the phrase ""flee east"" is different from the word ""fleeced"" in that the first has a ___ stop at the beginning of ""east"".","glottal, glottal"
Ch1,19,"To summarize, the consonants we have been discussing so far may be described in terms of five factors: 1) ___ of the vocal folds (voiced or voiceless); ___ of articulation; central or ___ articulation; sounds); and ___ of articulatory action.","state, place, lateral, manner"
Ch1,20,"In the production of vowel sounds, the articulators do not come very close together, and the passage of the airstream is relatively ___. For this reason, it is much more difficult to feel the position of the tongue during vowel sounds, than in consonants. We can describe vowel sounds roughly in terms of the position of the ___ point of the tongue and the position of the lips. (As we will see later, more accurate descriptions can be made in acoustic terms.) Figure 1.13 shows the articulatory position for the vowels in heed, hid, head, had, father, good, food. Of course, in saying these words, the tongue and lips are in ___ motion throughout the vowels, as we saw in the x-ray movie in example 1.1 on the book’s website. The positions shown in the figure are best considered as the targets of the ___ for the vowels.","unobstructed, highest, continuous, gestures"
Ch1,20,"As you can see, in all these vowel gestures, the tongue tip is down behind the lower front teeth, and the body of the tongue is domed upward. Check that this is so in your own pronunciation. You will notice that you can prolong the [ h ] sound and that there is no mouth movement between the [ h ] and the fol- lowing vowel; the [ h ] is like a ___ version of the vowel that comes after it. In the first four vowels, the highest point of the tongue is in the front of the mouth. Accordingly, these vowels are called ___ vowels. ","voiceless, front"
Ch1,21,"Now try saying the vowels in ""father, good, food"".  In all three, the tongue is close to the back surface of the vocal tract. These vowels are classified as ___ vowels. The body of the tongue is ___ in the vowel in food (which is therefore called a high back vowel) and ___ in the first vowel in father (which is therefore called a low back vowel). ","back, highest, lowest"
Ch1,22,"Look at the position of your lips in a mirror while you say just the vowels in heed, hid, head, had, father, good, food. You will probably find that in the last two words, there is a move- ment of the lips in addition to the movement that occurs because of the lowering and raising of the jaw. This movement is called lip ___. It is usually most noticeable in the inward movement of the corners of the lips. Vowels may be described as being ___ (as in who’d) or ___ (as in heed).","rounding, rounded, unrounded"
Ch1,22,"In summary, the targets for vowel gestures can be described in terms of three factors: (1) the ___ of the body of the tongue; (2) the front–back position of the tongue; and (3) the ___ of lip rounding. The ___ positions of the highest points of the tongue are given in Figure 1.14. Say just the vowels in the words given in the figure caption and check that your tongue moves in the pattern described by the points. It is very difficult to become aware of the position of the tongue in vowels, but you can probably get some impression of tongue height by observing the position of your jaw while saying just the vowels in the four words ""heed, hid, head, had"". You should also be able to feel the difference between front and back vowels by contrasting words such as ""he"" and ""who"". Say these words silently and concentrate on the sensations involved. You should feel the tongue going from front to back as you say ""he, who"". You can also feel your lips becoming more ___.","height, degree, relative, rounded"
Ch1,22,"As you can see from Figure 1.14, the specification of vowels in terms of the position of the highest point of the tongue is not entirely ___ for a number of reasons. First, the vowels classified as high do not have the same tongue height. The back high vowel (point 7) is nowhere near as high as the front vowel (point 1). Second, the so-called back vowels vary considerably in their degree of “___.”","satisfactory, backness"
Ch1,24,"Vowels and consonants can be thought of as the ___ of which speech is composed. Together they form the ___ that make up utterances. Super-imposed on the syllables are other features known as ___. These include ___ in stress and pitch. Variations in length are also usually considered to be suprasegmental features, although they can affect single segments as well as whole syllables. ","segments, syllables, suprasegmentals, variations"
Ch1,25,"Pitch changes due to variations in laryngeal activity can occur ___ly of stress changes. They are associated with the rate of vibration of the vocal folds. Earlier in the chapter, we called this the “voice pitch” to distinguish between the characteristic overtones of vowels (“vocal tract pitches”) and the rate of vocal fold vibration. Pitch of the voice is what you alter to sing different notes in a song. Because each opening and closing of the vocal folds causes a peak of air ___ in the sound wave, we can estimate the pitch of a sound by observing the rate of occurrence of the peaks in the waveform. To be more exact, we can measure the frequency of the sound in this way. ___ is a techni- cal term for an acoustic property of a sound—namely, the number of complete repetitions (cycles) of a pattern of air pressure variation occurring in a second. The unit of frequency measurement is the ___, usually abbreviated Hz. If the vocal folds make 220 complete opening and closing movements in a second, we say that the frequency of the sound is 220 Hz. The frequency of the vowel [ a ] shown in Figure 1.4 was 100 Hz, as the vocal fold pulses occurred every 10 ms (one-hundredth of a second).","independent, pressure, Frequency, hertz"
Ch1,25,"The pitch of a sound is an auditory property that enables a listener to place it on a scale going from low to high, without considering its acoustic properties. In practice, when a speech sound goes up in frequency, it also goes up in pitch. For the most part, at an introductory level of the subject, the pitch of a sound may be equated with its ___ frequency, and, indeed, some books do not distin- guish between the two terms, using pitch for both the ___ property and the physical attribute.","fundamental, auditory"
Ch1,25,"The pitch pattern in a sentence is known as the ___. Listen to the intonation (the variations in the pitch of the voice) when someone says the sentence ""This is my father"".  Try to find out which syllable has the highest pitch and which the lowest. In most people’s speech, the highest pitch will occur on the first syllable of 'father' and the lowest on the second, the last syllable in the sentence. Now observe the pitch changes in the question ""Is this your father?"" In this sentence, the first syllable of father is usually on a ___ pitch than the last syllable. In English, it is even possible to change the meaning of a sentence, such as ""That’s a cat"", from a ___ to a question without altering the order of the words. If you substitute a mainly rising for a mainly falling intonation, you will produce a question spoken with an air of astonishment: ""That’s a cat?""","intonation, lower, statement"
Ch1,26,"All the suprasegmental features are characterized by the fact that they must be described in relation to other items in the same utterance. It is the ___ values of pitch, length, or degree of stress of an item that are significant. You can stress one syllable as opposed to another irrespective of whether you are shouting or talking softly. Children can also use the same intonation patterns as adults, although their voices have a ___ pitch. The absolute values are never ___ important. But they do, of course, convey information about the speaker’s age, sex, emotional state, and attitude toward the topic under discussion.","relative, higher, linguistically"
